# Web developer (loving JavaScript) and generalist engineer (loving Astrophysics)

## Story

I am a graduate generalist engineer, specialising in software development. I developed an interest in the computing field during several periods of work experience: two internships (2013 & 2014) and an apprenticeship (2015). Since finishing my studies in 2015, I have begun to develop my own self-employment activity in parallel with my graduate studies. This began in my first graduate year when I developed a CRM tool (with Drupal) for a small company. My will and curiosity have led me to improve my computing knowledge by continuing in the web development field. During 2 years I have been specialised in C# .NET and since 2017 in JavaScript technologies especially ReactJS. A first 10-month experience as ReactJS developer at Cdiscount led me to a role as technical referent. Since 2017 I am working to improve developer experience, train developers, develop and maintain core libraries, and animate the developer community.

## Plan for the future

Work in nice team context to share human and technical knowledges.

## Fulfillment

I really love to have a look at the new technologies, especially JavaScript ones. At the moment I am trying out developing NodeJS CLI, Docker, and React Admin. I am really passionate about the sciences especially astrophysics. I love wood works, and regularly practice alpinisme, climbing, and surfing.
